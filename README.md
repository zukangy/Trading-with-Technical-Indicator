# Trading-with-Technical-Indicator

I hope to collect a variety of technical trading indicators and backtest their predictiviness using Zipline library (a Pythonic algorithmic trading libray) in Python. For me, it is a great opportunity to expand my horizon in the world of technical trading; and for you, it will be a great resource to learn about the Zipline backtesting framework. As far as I know, Zipline had been the best algo trading library out there until its creator Quantopian, Inc was acquired by Robinhood; yet there are still many private developers maintaining this library. As I have not seen many open-sourced trading strategies written in Zipline, I want this project to serve as enducational materials for any new traders wanting to join this sector.
